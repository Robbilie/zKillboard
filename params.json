{"name":"zKillboard","tagline":"","body":"## zKillboard\r\nzKillboard is a killboard created for EVE-Online, for use on zkillboard.com, but can also be used for single entities.\r\n\r\n#### License and Copyright\r\nLicensing for all files in this repository can be found in in AGPL.md\r\n\r\n## WARNING WARNING\r\nThis is the latest verison of zKillboard.com, which prefers NoSQL over MySQL. If you do not have experience with installing and maintaining a NoSQL database, specifically TokuMX v2.4, we do not recommend you try this at home unless you truly enjoy a challenge! There are some aspects of zKillboard.com that still utilize MySQL, but that is only because they haven't been integrated into NoSQL yet.\r\n\r\n### History and previous versions\r\nzKillboard.com came as the brainchild of Squizz Caphinator who wanted to improve upon [http://wiki.eve-id.net/EDK](Eve-Dev Killboard). Squizz decided to write a new killboard completely from scratch and began the zKillboard project. Karbowiak of eve-kill.net eventually joined into the project, contributed much code,, [created a repository on Github](https://github.com/EVE-KILL/zKillboard), and announced zkillboard as the new Beta killboard for eve-kill.net. zKillboard matured and gained a fanbase, and of course, haters. As time went on Squizz and Karbowiak had some differences and Squizz forked his code into [this repository](https://github.com/3zLabs/zKillboard) and made this new repository the primary code base for zkillboard.com. After about a year Squizz then began dabbling in NoSQL, as it seemed the perfect database for the type of data consumed by zKillboard. Two months of heavy coding and extreme database changes, the repository [zKillboard/zKillboard](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard) was created to make the code public to the masses with the various NoSQL changes.\r\n\r\nFun fact: zKillboard.com was originally called killwhore.com until it was discovered that the Eve Online forums censored the word whore.\r\n\r\n## WARNING\r\nThis is BETA, which means it is a work in progress.  It lacks complete documentation and is currently not meant for use in production.\r\n\r\nSince zKillboard is a beta product, it has a code base that is far from complete and enjoys numerous updates, deletions, and modifications to the code and accompanying tables. Please feel free to attempt to install zKillboard on your own server, however, we are not responsible for any difficulties you come across during installation and continuing execution of the product.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nzKillboard is released under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.

This of course depends on the cronjob being setup.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
